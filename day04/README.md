Written exercise

Easiest to do with pen and paper

### 3 A bit more practice with doubles
This confuses me 100% not the java bit but what is this mortgage.
In particular the question 
*The number of years before the interest is paid and only the initial capital remains*
suggests that this is some kind of mortgage where you pay off all the interest before
repaying any capital. Could implement http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage
but should check the specification the "customer" has set before implementing the wrong
thing.
