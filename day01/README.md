"Exercises, day 1"
==================

Oliver Smart oliver@osmart.plus.com

* I decided to do exercises in simple java, rather than groovy or javadecaf
  avoided using eclipse as instructed.
* Trying to avoid use of methods or anything fancy (but gave in to temptation)

Files:
## Exercise 4 Prime Numbers 

**Prime04.java** Prompts and checks for primes. Single main

**Prime04A.java** Separate out methods (old style) *naughty* 


## 5 Multiplication

**Multiplication05.java** does not use * operator, deals with negative numbers. 
Use for loop (not sure whether this is allowed).

## 7 Naive Sorting

**NaiveSort07.java** 

## 9 Going up!

**GoingUp09.java**

## 11 Poker hands (harder)

**PokerHands11basic.java** As instructed. Single main no loops no methods.
 I found this painful. To do in a single main without any loops or methods means one
ends up with a program that appears to work but cannot be tested. Could not get
java to read redirected input so could not script a test and any way the
user prompt program is difficult to script.  

**PokerHands11.java** not finished attempt at doing with C like method calls. Abandoned.
