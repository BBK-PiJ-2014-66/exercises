Exercises, day 1
================
* Exercise sheet [00_exercise_week_1_day_1.pdf](00_exercise_week_1_day_1.pdf)
* I decided to do exercises in simple java, rather than groovy or javadecaf
  avoided using eclipse as instructed.
* Trying to avoid use of methods, arrays or anything fancy *(but gave in to temptation)*

##  4 Prime Numbers 
[Prime04.java](Prime04.java) Prompts and checks for primes. Single main. 

[Prime04A.java](Prime04A.java) Separate out and use (old style) methods *naughty* 


## 5 Multiplication
[Multiplication05.java](Multiplication05.java) does not use * operator, deals with negative numbers. 
Use for loop (not sure whether this is allowed).

## 6 Division
[E06Division.java](E06Division.java) conforms to full rules. No methods all in main. 
Uses ternary operator. Deals with negative inputs for either number entered.
Protects against division by zero.

## 7 Naive Sorting
[NaiveSort07.java](NaiveSort07.java) Uses Math.max but in comments ternary operator as an alternative.

## 8 Maximizing
[E08Maximising.java](E08Maximising.java) Works. All in main. Handles exceptions on input.

## 9 Going up!
[E09GoingUp.java](E09GoingUp.java) All in main, handles exceptions, conforms to spec. Trys to use
clear java-type variable names to make it easy to read.

## 10 You said high, I said low. . .
[E10YouSaidHighISaidLow.java](E10YouSaidHighISaidLow.java) All in main, handles exceptions, conforms to spec.

## 11 Poker hands (harder)
[PokerHands11basic.java](PokerHands11basic.java) As instructed. Single main no loops no methods.
 I found this painful. To do in a single main without any loops or methods means one
ends up with a program that appears to work but cannot be tested. Could not get
java to read redirected input so could not script a test and any way the
user prompt program is difficult to script.  

[PokerHands11.java](PokerHands11.java) not finished first attempt at doing with C like method calls. Abandoned. 
*have to play by the rules!*
