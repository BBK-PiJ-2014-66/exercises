/* 
 * Birbeck MSc Computer Science PiJ coursework From September 2014
 *  
 * Week 1 Exercise 9 Going up!
 * task set:
 * Read an arbitrarily long sequence of positive numbers from the user, until -1
 * is entered. At that point, print "Yes" if the numbers were consecutive and
 * increasing and "No‚Äù otherwise. Sequences "1,2,3,4,-1" and "5,6,7,8,9,1,0,11,-1"
 * should output "Yes", but "2,3,5,6,7,-1", "10,9,8,7,-1", and "1,1,2,3,4,5,-1"
 * should output "No"
 *
 * Not allowed methods and everything must be in main.
