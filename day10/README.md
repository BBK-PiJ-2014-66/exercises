## The exercise sheet [exercises_d10.pdf](exercises_d10.pdf) 

# 1 Extension, extension. . .

Completed:

* [Phone.java](src/Phone.java) original interface.
* [OldPhone.java](src/OldPhone.java) Old-style phone just makes calls.
* [MobilePhone.java](src/MobilePhone.java) with alarm, games and number store.

# 2 Overriding

# 3 Passing information to ancestor classes

# 4 Visibility

## 4.1 Increasing visibility

* Told to change visibility of  *playGame(String)* in [MobilePhone.java](src/MobilePhone.java) to *private*. 
  So  [SmartPhone.java](src/SmartPhone.java) cannot use this method and instead we have to provide
  a new implementation in [SmartPhone.java](src/SmartPhone.java) itself.
