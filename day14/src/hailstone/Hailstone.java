 * 
 * 3 Hailstone numbers
 * 
 * task:
 * 
 * The sequence hailstone numbers is defined as follows:
 * 
 * If the number n is even, the next number is n/2
 * 
 * If the number is odd, the next number is 3n + 1
 * 
 * It is thought that this sequence always converges to 1 (this is the Collatz
 * conjecture, not demonstrated yet). Write a method that returns a list of
 * integers (hint: you can use List<Integer> and ArrayList<Integer>) with the
 * sequence of hailstone numbers that starts at some given natural number
 * provided by the user.
 * 
 * When list hits 1 terminate
