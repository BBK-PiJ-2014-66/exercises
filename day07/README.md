# Exercises, day 07

## The exercise sheet [exercises_d7.pdf](exercises_d7.pdf) 


# 1 Instance counter
[Spy.java](Spy.java) works but the number of spys is not correctly decremented if a spy goes out
of context - not sure whether it is possible or wanted? May be should reimplement using linked lists?


#2 do {practice} while {!understood}
[E02DoWhile.java](E02DoWhile.java) written with *do while* but refactored to *while (true)*
and a break. For test output see last commit message.

#3 Singly-linked lists and 4 Queue length
Work in [Patient.java](Patient.java) and  [HospitalManager.java](HospitalManager.java) written.
(The output is contained in last commit message for either). 

Seems a bit of a mess. Mixing patients with how to store a list? Surely in OO coding we should
design a nice interface that hides how a patient list is stored but provides easily understood
methods? 

# Doubly-linked lists
[E05DoublyLinkedLists.java](E05DoublyLinkedLists.java) started.
