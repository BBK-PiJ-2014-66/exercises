## The exercise sheet [exercises_d7.pdf](exercises_d7.pdf) 


# 1 Instance counter
[Spy.java](Spy.java) works but the number of spys is not correctly decremented if a spy goes out
of context - not sure whether it is possible or wanted? May be should reimplement using linked lists?


#2 do {practice} while {!understood}
[E02DoWhile.java](E02DoWhile.java) written with *do while* but refactored to *while (true)*
and a break. For test output see last commit message.

#3 Singly-linked lists
[Patient.java](Patient.java)
