 * Day 7 Exercise 9 From array to list
 *
 * Task set:

Create a static method that takes an array of integers and returns a linked
list of integers in the same order as the original array. You can put this
method in a class called ListUtilities so that you can easily use it for the
following exercises.

Initialising an array with 15-20 elements is very easy with
curly-brackets-notation, so it is common to create an array and then convert it
into a dynamic structure automatically.


 * My thoughts:
 * Should be able to simply use override pop from previous Stack exercise
 * to take an array rather than an integer.
