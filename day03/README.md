### 12 Distance point–to–point
[E12DistancePointToPoint.java](E12DistancePointToPoint.java) 
uses the Point class as instructed (there is a java standard
Point class but I assumed we where meant to do our own). 
Decided to use Class methods because this produces much 
cleaner code. Program has **-test** option to demonstrate 
methods work for the case where points are on isosceles and
equilateral triangles. Output of -test run 
[E12DistancePointToPoint-test.md](E12DistancePointToPoint-test.md).

### 13 Rectangle
[E13Rectangle.java](E13Rectangle.java) interesting example I had
to use explicit constructors to get it to work. Bit confused because
I didn't think we were meant to have done them yet? Recorded
output of **-test** option as well as normal users input operation in
[E13Rectangle_Output.md](E13Rectangle_output.md).

### 14 Inside or outside
[E14InsideOrOutside.java](E14InsideOrOutside.java) extends E13 code.
Example outputs given in [E14InsideOrOutside_output.md](E14InsideOrOutside_output.md).
