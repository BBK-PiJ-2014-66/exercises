 * Birbeck MSc Computer Science PiJ coursework From September 2014
 *  
 * Day 3 Exercise 1 Calculator
 * task set:
 *    Write a program that reads two numbers from the user and then offers a 
 *    menu with the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, 
 *    multiplication, and division. Once the user has selected an operation
 *    from the menu, the calculator performs the operation.
 * 
 *    Hint: In the same way that there exists an Integer.parseInt() method 
 *    to parse integers, there is a Double.parseDouble() method to parse 
 *    real numbers.

 *
 *  Initial thoughts
 * (a) has to be interactive
 * (b) task does not decribe what to after the calculator performs
 *     the operation. But as it is a menu lets allow another operation.
 * (c) User can terminate program by hitting enter at any prompt
