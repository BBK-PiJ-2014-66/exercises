 * Birbeck MSc Computer Science PiJ coursework From September 2014
 *  
 * Day 3 Exercise 14 Inside or outside
 * task set:
 *    Write a program that reads the coordinates of the two points 
 *    defining a rectangle and then the coordinates of a third 
 *    point. The program must then determine whether the point 
 *    falls inside or outside the rectangle.
 *
 * Initial ideas:
 *    A simple extension of Exercise 13. 
 *    May as well add explicit constructors for the Point class
 *    to end up with more elegant code.
