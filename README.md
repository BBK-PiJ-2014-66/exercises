Programming in Java Exercises
=============================

Exercises from Programming in Java course http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/BUCI033S7.php

Approach to completing the exercises:
* In common with most other students separate "days" exercise are done in a folder of their own. Given that we are set ~5 to ~15 exercises per "day" and the course will have > 20 days then separate folders are a really good idea.
* I start by commiting the problem sheet (if this causes copyright problems please let me know!) I want to be able to easily find the questions for instance when offline.
* To make it easier to find the answer to an exercise it is called E01..., E02...  *(avoid 1, 2, 3, ...  numbering schemes because 10 comes before 2)*
* It is useful to record the task to be completed at the top of each program. In addition I try to record initial ideas used and I commit this before doing any work. I find this to be a useful exercise in clarifying what is to be done.
* Commiting small and often is good practice. A commit message should briefly describe what the change in code is in English however the most important thing is to record **why** the change has been made. In my work I have come across cases where someone has changed a hard code parameter from 2 to 4 and put in the commit message "changed FOOBAR to 4". Three years later we have a customer problem that suggests that 2 would be correct. Why was the number changed before. Guess what the developer could not remember and made no record. Good commit messages help everyone. 
* I am used to record the evidence that a particular program or feature works. Here I have used githib type markdown to produce such records (but I will switch to asciidoc because it is easier). *(but this is probably overkill here)*
* Please note that sometimes answers include things we have not seen yet like methods.
